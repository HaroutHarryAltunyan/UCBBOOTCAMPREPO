## Before next class...

1. In Bootcampspot, read the [Module 10 Weekly Wrap Up](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/3781/pages/10-weekly-wrap-up?module_item_id=1005069). Focus on the "What You Learned" section. Answering these questions (or most of them) with your own words **really does help**. This strategy has been used by some of my best students. If you don't feel comfortable with any of these topics:

   - review the class videos
   - redo the Week 10 activities
   - review the links in the [Week 10 pre-read](./pre-read.md)

1. In Bootcampspot read:

   - [Module 11 Express.js](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/3781/pages/11-module-11-express-dot-js?module_item_id=1005085)
