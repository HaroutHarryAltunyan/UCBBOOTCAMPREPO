## Github Student Developer Pack

Students should have received an email providing 12 months access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack, providing them with $13 in free Heroku credits each month, which they'll need to complete several of the Challenge assignments and projects in the second half of the course. Let them know that once they receive the email, they should ensure that they're logged into their GitHub account before clicking on the link in the email to activate their access to the Student Developer Pack.
