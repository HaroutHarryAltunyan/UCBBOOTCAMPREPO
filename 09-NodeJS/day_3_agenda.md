## Before next class...

1. In Bootcampspot, read the [Module 9 Weekly Wrap Up](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5728/modules/items/1304405). Focus on the "What You Learned" section. Answering these questions (or most of them) with your own words **really does help**. This strategy has been used by some of my best students. If you don't feel comfortable with any of these topics:

   - review the class videos
   - redo the Week 9 activities
   - review the links in the [Week 9 pre-read](./pre-read.md)
   - get a study group together. Explain these concepts to each other in your own words
   - Try to teach someone else (not in the class)

1. In Bootcampspot read:

   - [Module 10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5728/modules/items/1304410)
   - [Module 10: Roadmap](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5728/modules/items/1304412)
   - [Module 10 Up and Running](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5728/modules/items/1304414). There are some videos here that might help you understand what we are doing this week.

1. Read the [Week 10 Day 1 pre-read](../10-OOP/pre-read.md) in `10-OOP`
