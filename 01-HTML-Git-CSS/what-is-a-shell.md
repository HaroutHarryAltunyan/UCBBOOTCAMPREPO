# What is a shell?

A shell is an **application** that runs in the Mac terminal or GitBash on the Windows PC. The shell's interface is called a **command line** aka "CLI" for **command line interface**. This shell allows us access to the computer's file system and a vast variety of useful applications you can only run from the command line (i.e., you can't run them from the computer's **graphical user interface** aka "GUI"). The shell's command line interface is essentially a prompt, after which you enter your command.

You might notice that there are different shells. We are using `zsh` in the Mac terminal and `bash` in GitBash on Windows. There are others but these are the most common. These shells are all very similar but do have some variation in what commands they provide, API's (application programmer interface) for customization, and configuration methods.

Which is better? Well that is a matter of opinion. `bash` is older than `zsh`. I have been using `bash` up until this last year and it's completely acceptable. `zsh` provides more "interactivity" and customization: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/361870/what-are-the-practical-differences-between-bash-and-zsh
