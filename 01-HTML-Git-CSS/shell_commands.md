# Common shell commands I use in class

`pwd`  
present working directory, i.e., the working directory where your prompt is located

`cd`  
change directory, e.g., `cd mycooldir`. In this case, `mycooldir` is the path to the destination directory. `cd` can use some special directories. `./` identifies the directory you are currently in. `../` identifies the directory which contains the working directory. `~` is your account profile's directory. For example to change directory to your Desktop folder in your profile folder you would type `cd ~/Desktop`.

`ls`  
get a file listing. To list a directory outside of the present working directory add a file path, e.g., `ls ../`

`echo $0`  
This shows what kind of shell you are using
