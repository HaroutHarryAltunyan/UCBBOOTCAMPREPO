## Before next class...

1. In Bootcampspot, read the [Module 2 Weekly Wrap Up](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5728/pages/2-weekly-wrap-up-2?module_item_id=1304204). Focus on the "What You Learned" section. Answering these questions (or most of them) with your own words **really does help**. This strategy has been used by some of my best students. If you don't feel comfortable with any of these topics:

   - review the class videos
   - redo the Week 2 activities
   - review the links in the [Week 2 pre-read](./pre-read.md)

1. Do the [Module 2 assessment](https://forms.gle/72YzfNppttviTD8a6) as a self check. It is not part of your grade but useful to again see how much you have gained this week.
