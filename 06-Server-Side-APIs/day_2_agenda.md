## Study suggestions

1. In Bootcampspot, read the [Module 5 Weekly Wrap Up](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/4767/pages/5-weekly-wrap-up?module_item_id=1151419). Focus on the "What You Learned" section. Answering these questions (or most of them) with your own words **really does help**. This strategy has been used by some of my best students. If you don't feel comfortable with any of these topics:

   - Do the [Week 5 interview prep](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2Ud0tQbrQouRilWdMsJb7c75zikzOC9e0oA7TSkXF6kaYDg/viewform)
   - review the class videos
   - redo the Week 5 activities
   - review the links in the [Week 5 pre-read](./pre-read.md)
   - get a study group together. Explain these concepts to each other in your own words
   - Try to teach someone else (not in the class)

1. In Bootcampspot read:

   - [Module 6: Server-Side APIs](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/4767/pages/6-module-06-server-side-apis)
   - [Module 6: Roadmap](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/4767/pages/6-roadmap)
   - [Module 6 Up and Running](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/4767/pages/6-up-and-running?module_item_id=1151441). There are some videos here that might help you understand what we are doing this week.
   - [Module 6.1 Introduction to fetch](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/4767/pages/06-dot-1-introduction-to-fetch?module_item_id=1151450)

1. Spend at least 30 minutes working on the Week 4 Mini Project. It has some good techniques on how to get started.
1. Read the [Week 6 Day 2 pre-read](./pre-read.md) in `06-Server-Side-APIs`
1. Keep working on the [Week 5 Challenge](../05-Third-Party-APIs/02-Challenge/README.md). It is due Wednesday January 24th.
