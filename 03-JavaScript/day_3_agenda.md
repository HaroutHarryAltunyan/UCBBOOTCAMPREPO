## Before next class...

1. In Bootcampspot, read the [Module 3 Weekly Wrap Up](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5728/modules/items/1304236). Focus on the "What You Learned" section. Answering these questions (or most of them) with your own words **really does help**. This strategy has been used by some of my best students. If you don't feel comfortable with any of these topics:

   - review the class videos
   - redo the Week 3 activities
   - review the links in the [Week 3 pre-read](./pre-read.md)
   - get a study group together. Explain these concepts to each other in your own words
   - Try to teach someone else (not in the class)

1. In Bootcampspot read:

   - [Module 4: Web APIs ](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5728/modules/items/1304240)
   - [Module 4 Roadmap](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5728/modules/items/1304243)
   - [Module 4 Up and Running](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5728/modules/items/1304245)

1. Work on the Week 3 Mini Project
1. Read the [Week 3 Day 1 pre-read](../04-Web-APIs/pre-read.md) in `04-Web APIs`
