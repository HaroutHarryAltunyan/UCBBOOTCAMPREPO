/*
 1. Identify the steps
  - start listing the things that need to happen, start with big steps
  - break bigger steps into smaller ones
  - look for patterns:
    - decision ponts (i.e., conditionals)
    - things that happen a set number of times (i.e., loops)
    - things that require copying the same code over and over again (i.e., good place for a function)
  - order the steps
  - use comments to layout the steps in your code file
*/

/*
  2. Identify functions
  - given the steps above, create appropriate functions
  - maybe you don't know what the implmentation is yet, that's ok that can com later
*/

/*
 3. Declare variables: state
    - What are the datq that need to be kept track of? 
    - Global state variables emerge while working on the steps (i.e., it
      becomes clearer what needs to be tracked across the application)
    - state variables:
      "State describes the status of the entire program or an individual
       object. It could be text, a number, a boolean, or another data type.

       Itâ€™s a common tool for coordinating code. For example, once you update state, a bunch of different functions can instantly react to that change."
       https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/state-in-javascript-explained-by-cooking-a-simple-meal-2baf10a787ee/
    - Does the state variable need to be global (i.e., used by all the event handlers) or does it only need to be local
      to the event handler?
*/

/*
 4. Declare variables: constants
    - What are the data the application needs that won't change?
    - e.g. Math constants, pre-created content (maybe a list of characters)
*/

/*
 5. Implement the steps
    - Create code for all the steps you identified
    - Code in small pieces, testing each change along the way
    - make git commits along the way when your code is at a stable place
*/

/*
 6. Refactor
    - identify tasks that can be broken into their own functions
    - maybe there are more efficient ways to impelment your program
*/
